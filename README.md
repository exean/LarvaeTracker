# LarvaeTracker

Tracking suite. Specialized for use with FTIR-like data and tracking of Drosophila larvae.
Automated tracking via different algorithms (extendable through a basic plugin-system) as well as manual tracking through a simple GUI.

Requires OpenCV 2.4.1 and QT 4.8.4

## Model representation of a larva

Each larva is represented as an ordered list of points v with radius b. The number N of points can be set freely to achieve the desired number of segments of a virtual larva-spine S'. The confirmation of a larva is represented through the angles Ï† at each point v.

A model-based energy-projection visualizes expected movement of a larvae.

## Collisions and Separation

Differents algorithms are available to separate colliding larvae. Manual separation via the GUI is also possible.
